		<h3>
			Í Overwatch eru spilalegu kallarnir kallaðar hetjur. Einmitt Núna eru 23 Hetjur í leiknum hægta að spila. Hetjurnar eru brotnar niður í fjóra hópa. Offense, Defense, Tank og Support. Í flestum leikjum muna vera tvær hetjur frá offense eða defense hópnum, tveir Tanks og tveir Support. Offense og Defense hetjurnar eru oft Kallaðar "DPS" hetjur, því starf þeirra er að gera mikin skaða í stuttum tíma
